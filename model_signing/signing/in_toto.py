"""Signing payloads for models as in-toto statements.

To generate the signing payload we convert model manifests to in-toto formats,
as described by https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/main/spec/v1. The
envelope format is DSSE, see https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse.

    In this case, we encode the model as the only subject of the statement. We
    don't set the name field, and use the digest as the one resulting from the
    model serialization.

    However, since we use custom hashing algorithms, but these are not supported
    by existing tools, we claim that the digest algorithm is sha-256 and include
    the real digest in the predicate.

    should be assumed that the digest is actually computed via the algorithm
