"""Machinery for representing a serialized representation of an ML model.

When saving a model, or signing an existing one, we build a manifest from the
model (either by using a `serialization.Serializer` or building it from helper
methods that use precomputed values to reduce amount of I/O involved). This is
the manifest used for generating a signature of the model.

When testing the integrity of a model, we start with the model path and model
type. From this, we extract the path to the signed manifest. Next step is to
verify the authenticity of the signature, after which we extract an in-memory
representation of the _expected_ manifest. To verify the integrity of the model,
we run another `serialization.Serializer` instance to compute the _actual_
manifest of the model as we're seeing it. If these two manifests agree then the
model integrity is maintained.

In the simplest case, we are working with `DigestManifest` objects. Here, the
two manifests agree if and only if the digests are the same. A more complex case
is when the manifest itemizes each model component (e.g., every file (or file
shard) is paired with its digest). The manifests agree if every file and digest
matches. Alternatively, we could allow for file renames, and check only the
digests. Optionally, we can have arbitrary logic, saying that the actual
manifest (i.e., files of the model as they are on disk) must match only a subset
of the expected one: e.g., we could have a model saved in multiple formats but
with a single signature. At verification time, only one format is used, so we
only need to verify the corresponding subset. We need to check that we still
have a valid complete model though.

In the future, we envision an API that would allow verification to be done in a
streaming fashion. As the model is loaded for inference, only the integrity of
the part that gets loaded would be verified, to not penalize inference hosts
when only a tiny subset of a large model is used. This also means that we can
add support for updating a manifest in a streaming fashion while a model is
trained (or post-training to update ancillary files -- requires re-signing).

All these alternative scenarios will be implemented by various subclasses of the
`Manifest` class defined here. Itemized manifests make use of `ItemizedManifest`
objects to represent only a part of the model that can be verified individually.
