"""Precomputed digests.

In order to support digests computed by external tooling, we provide trivial
`HashEngine` instances that just wrap around the digest.

Example usage:
```python
>>> hasher = PrecomputedDigest("short-hash", b"abcd")
>>> digest = hasher.compute()
>>> digest.digest_hex
'61626364'
>>> digest.algorithm
'short-hash'
```
