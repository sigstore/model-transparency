# Changelog

All notable changes to `model-signing` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

All versions prior to 1.0.0 are untracked.

## [Unreleased]

- Added support for signing with PKCS #11 devices
- Fix handling of certificate that has no KeyUsage
- Fix ignoring of git-related files
- Record files in signature that were ignored when signature was created and automatically ignore those files when verifying signature
- Adjust model name when signing and verifying in model_path '.' and other fixes related to file paths
- Fix and test the sharded file hasher
- Added tests for verifying signatures created with v0.3.1
- cli: `model_signing sign` now supports the `--oauth_force_oob` option (default: False)
- Added support for specifying `--client_id` and `--client_secret` for OIDC authentication
- cli: Added support for `--allow_symlinks` option
- Added more informative signature mismatch errors: The `ValueError` raised during model verification when a signature mismatch occurs now includes detailed information
- Fix Bundle deserialization error caused by null keyid in DSSE signatures; keyid now serializes as an empty string
- Implemented public key identifier hash matching for bundle verification
- Add warning for older verification material formats (e.g., raw public key bytes) during verification, recommending re-signing
- Added guidance to `README.md` on how to install `model-signing` with PKCS#11 support.
- Added support trace sigstore sign and verify operations using OpenTelemetry.
- cli: Added support for `--ignore_unsigned_files` option
- Implemented a new, minimal container image. This variant excludes optional dependencies (like OTel and PKCS#11) to reduce footprint, focusing solely on core signing and verification mechanisms.
- The library now requires at least v4.0.0 of `sigstore` due to breaking changes in that library
- Added support for signing and verifying using private Sigstore instances (`--trust_config`)

## [1.0.1] - 2024-04-18

### Added
- Added support for pre v1.0 signatures used in production. This is only provided for verification and replicates the experimental behavior at v0.2, bug for bug.
- Added support for displaying fingerprints of certificates when using signing certificates

### Fixed
- Fix bug in CLI scripts where even if signature verification failed, the script would also output that verification passed and exit with success error code.
- Docker containers wrapping around the CLI have been changed to support the updated CLI

## [1.0.0] - 2024-04-04

### Added
- First stable release of `model_signing`.
- Stable, backwards-compatible API.
- Stable, clean, backwards-compatible CLI wrapping the API.
- Well-defined signature scheme based on Sigstore bundle and DSSE envelope.
- Well-defined, future proof, stable, in-toto format for the model signature.
- Signing and verification using Sigstore, public/private key pairs, and signing certificates.
- Support for signing/verification via scripts in the repo (`hatch run python -m model_signing`), installing the pip package (`python -m model_signing` or `model_signing`), or Docker containers that wrap around the CLI.
- Support for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- [Demo notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/18IB_uipduXYq0ohMxJv2xHfeihLIcGMT) to showcase API and CLI examples.
