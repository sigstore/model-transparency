## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- Added support for signing with PKCS #11 devices ([#411](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/411)), as an optional dependency ([#494](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/494)).
- Added support for signing and verifying using private Sigstore instances via the `--trust_config` option ([#460](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/460)).
- Added support for the `--oauth_force_oob` option for the signing CLI flow ([#471](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/471)).
- Added support for specifying `--client_id` and `--client_secret` for OIDC authentication with custom OAuth clients ([#475](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/475)).
- Surfaced the `--allow_symlinks` option to the CLI and library API ([#486](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/486)).
- Implemented public key identifier hash matching for bundle verification ([#493](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/493)).
- Added warning for older verification material formats (e.g., raw public key bytes) during verification, recommending re-signing ([#493](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/493)).
- Added more informative signature mismatch errors: The `ValueError` raised during model verification when a signature mismatch occurs now includes detailed information about what caused the signature verification to fail ([#495](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/495)).
- Created a new, minimal container image. This variant excludes optional dependencies (like OTel and PKCS#11) to reduce footprint, focusing solely on core signing and verification mechanisms ([#499](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/499)).
- Added support for `--ignore_unsigned_files` option in CLI to ignore files that are not part of the manifest but are still present in the model directory ([#501](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/501)).
- Added support to trace sign and verify operations using OpenTelemetry ([#503](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/503)).
- The library was migrated to require at least v4.0.0 of `sigstore` due to breaking changes in that library ([#532](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/532)). There are no breaking changes within the library itself, as these changes should be transparent to the users.
- The `sigstore_protobuf_specs` dependency was replaced with `sigstore_models` due to the same changes in `sigstore-4.0.0` ([#533](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/533)). These changes should also be transparent to the users.
- Added support for BLAKE3 hashing ([#538](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/538)).

### Changed
- Adjusted model name when signing and verifying when `model_path` is current directory ([#452](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/452)).
- Recorded files in signature that were ignored when signature was created and added ability to automatically ignore those files when verifying signature ([#462](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/462)).
- The Sigstore signer was changed to be lazily initialized to avoid network calls when not using it ([#467](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/467)).
- Logging was migrated to only be enabled when the user asks to log the certificate fingerprints ([#472](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/472)).

### Fixed
- Fixed bugs related to using `model_path='.'` in the signature, as well as other issues related to file paths ([#452](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/452)).
- Fixed handling of certificate that has no `KeyUsage` ([#457](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/457)).
- Fixed bug related to ignoring git files ([#462](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/462)).
- Fixed handling of ignored files in the sharded file hasher ([#465](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/465)).
- Fixed handling of path resulting from certificates returned from `certify` API ([#468](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/468)).
- Fixed deserialization bug related to optional values in protobuf API for keyid ([#490](https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency/pull/490)).

## [1.0.1] - 2025-04-18

### Added
- Added support for pre v1.0 signatures used in production. This is only provided for verification and replicates the experimental behavior at v0.2, bug for bug.
- Added support for displaying fingerprints of certificates when using signing certificates

### Fixed
- Fix bug in CLI scripts where even if signature verification failed, the script would also output that verification passed and exit with success error code.
- Docker containers wrapping around the CLI have been changed to support the updated CLI

## [1.0.0] - 2025-04-04

### Added
- First stable release of `model_signing`.
- Stable, backwards-compatible API.
- Stable, clean, backwards-compatible CLI wrapping the API.
- Well-defined signature scheme based on Sigstore bundle and DSSE envelope.
- Well-defined, future proof, stable, in-toto format for the model signature.
- Signing and verification using Sigstore, public/private key pairs, and signing certificates.
- Support for signing/verification via scripts in the repo (`hatch run python -m model_signing`), installing the pip package (`python -m model_signing` or `model_signing`), or Docker containers that wrap around the CLI.
- Support for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- [Demo notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/18IB_uipduXYq0ohMxJv2xHfeihLIcGMT) to showcase API and CLI examples.
