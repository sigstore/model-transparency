"""Machinery for computing digests for a single file.

Example usage for `SimpleFileHasher`:
```python
>>> with open("/tmp/file", "w") as f:
...     f.write("abcd")
>>> hasher = SimpleFileHasher("/tmp/file", SHA256())
>>> digest = hasher.compute()
>>> digest.digest_hex
'88d4266fd4e6338d13b845fcf289579d209c897823b9217da3e161936f031589'
```

Example usage for `ShardedFileHasher`, reading only the second part of a file:
```python
>>> with open("/tmp/file", "w") as f:
...     f.write("0123abcd")
>>> hasher = ShardedFileHasher("/tmp/file", SHA256(), start=4, end=8)
>>> digest = hasher.compute()
>>> digest.digest_hex
'88d4266fd4e6338d13b845fcf289579d209c897823b9217da3e161936f031589'
```

Example usage for `OpenedFileHasher`:
```python
>>> with open("/tmp/file", "w") as f:
...     f.write("abcd")
>>> with open("/tmp/file", "rb") as f:
...     hasher = OpenedFileHasher(f)
...     digest = hasher.compute()
