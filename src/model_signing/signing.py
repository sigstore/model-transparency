"""High level API for the signing interface of `model_signing` library.

The module allows signing a model with a default configuration:

```python
model_signing.signing.sign("finbert", "finbert.sig")
```

The module allows customizing the signing configuration before signing:

```python
model_signing.signing.Config().use_elliptic_key_signer(private_key="key").sign(
    "finbert", "finbert.sig"
)
```

The same signing configuration can be used to sign multiple models:

```python
signing_config = model_signing.signing.Config().use_elliptic_key_signer(
    private_key="key"
)

for model in all_models:
    signing_config.sign(model, f"{model}_sharded.sig")
```

The API defined here is stable and backwards compatible.

              cannot be used (not available, or option disabled), a flow to get

            use_staging: Use staging configurations, instead of production. This
              is supposed to be set to True only when testing. Default is False.
            force_oob: If True, forces an out-of-band (OOB) OAuth flow. If set,
              the OAuth authentication will not attempt to open the default web
              browser. Instead, it will display a URL and code for manual

              application making the request to the OIDC provider. If not

              required for confidential clients that need to prove their
              identity to the OIDC provider. If not provided, it is assumed
              that the client is public or the provider does not require a
              secret.

              the signature verification process will rely on the supplied
              PKI and trust configurations, instead of the default Sigstore
              setup. If not specified, the default Sigstore configuration
