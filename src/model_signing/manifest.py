"""Machinery for representing a serialized representation of an ML model.

A manifest pairs objects from the model (e.g., files, shards of files), with
their hashes. When signing the model we generate a manifest from serializing the
model (that is, computing the hashes for all the objects, according to the
specific serialization method used).

When verifying the integrity of the model, we extract a manifest from the
signature, after verifying the authenticity of the signature. Then, we serialize
the local model and compare the two manifests.

Comparing the manifests can be done by checking that everything matches, or, we
can only check partial object match. This is useful, for example, for the cases
where the original model contained files for multiple ML frameworks, but the
user only uses the model with one framework. This way, the user can verify the
integrity only for the files that are actually used.

          identifier and the integrity of the model implies integrity of all
          these items, ignoring any other descriptor). Corresponds to `name`,
          `uri`, or `content` in in-toto specification.
