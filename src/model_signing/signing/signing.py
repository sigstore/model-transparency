"""Machinery for signing and verification of ML models.

The serialization API produces a manifest representation of the models, and we
use that to implement integrity checking of models in different computational
patterns. This means that all manifests need to be kept only in memory.

Hence, for signing, we need a separate class hierarchy to represent the payload.
This is why we introduce `SigningPayload` abstract class here. Every instance of
this class is built via a `from_manifest` method (to allow for classes that need
initialization to be performed only once in their constructor but then convert
multiple manifests into payloads).

Since we need to support multiple signing methods (e.g., Sigstore, own PKI,
BCID), we provide a `Signer` abstract class with a single `sign` method that
takes a signing payload and converts it to a signature in the supported format.
Since signers may only accept payloads in specific formats, the `sign` method
can raise a `TypeError` if the provided `SigningPayload` instance is not
supported (due to typing rules, we cannot just use a subclass type for the
argument).

Every possible signature will be implemented as a subclass of `Signature` class.
The API for signatures only allows writing them to disk and parsing them from a
given path.

Finally, every signature needs to be verified. We pair every `Signer` subclass
with a `Verifier` which takes a signature, verify the authenticity of the
payload and then expand that to a `manifest.Manifest` subclass.
