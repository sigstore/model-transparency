"""High level API for the verification interface of `model_signing` library.

This module supports configuring the verification method used to verify a model,
before performing the verification.

```python
model_signing.verifying.Config().use_sigstore_verifier(
    identity=identity, oidc_issuer=oidc_provider
).verify("finbert", "finbert.sig")
```

The same verification configuration can be used to verify multiple models:

```python
verifying_config = model_signing.signing.Config().use_elliptic_key_verifier(
    public_key="key.pub"
)

for model in all_models:
    verifying_config.verify(model, f"{model}_sharded.sig")
```

The API defined here is stable and backwards compatible.
